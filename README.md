# Supporting Data: Temperature Insensitive Quasi-Phasematched SPDC
Supporting data for https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05134

Calculations for phasematching conditions, temperature tuning behaviour, and chromatic (longitudinal) phase compensation can be found in `PPKTP_TypeII.nb`, a [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) notebook created using Mathematica 11. Data necessary for the plotting of Figure 7 (proof-of-concept entangled source performance) can be found in `source_visibility_curves.csv`, in simple comma separated variable format.
